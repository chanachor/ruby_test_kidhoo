    <h4>Improve educational outcomes for all children, especially those with special needs.</h4>
    <!--<div class="why-details">
      <p>
        Approximately 2.5 million children with special needs in K-12 are at risk of not graduating high-school because of inadequate measurements and collaboration of their academic and behavioral goals and observations. Kidhoo transforms a proven manual and very cumbersome process used today in severe disability cases and makes it easier and accessible using latest technology.
